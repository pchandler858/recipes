# CHIMICHURRI


Ingredients  

-   6 cloves smoked garlic (it's still great if you don't smoke it)
-   1 shallot, minced
-   1 jalapeño, chopped fine
-   2 bunches cilantro, chopped
-   1 bunch flat leaf parsley, chopped
-   1/3 C fresh oregano, chopped fine
-   3/4 C extra virgin olive oil
-   1/2 C red wine vinegar
-   1 lemon, juiced
-   1 tsp [Meat Church Gourmet Season Salt](https://www.meatchurch.com/collections/frontpage/products/gourmet-season-salt "Meat Church Season Salt") 

Combine the smoked garlic, shallot, jalapeño, lemon juice and vinegar in a bowl. Whisk and allow to sit for 5-10 minutes. Add the cilantro, parsley and oregano. Mix in the oil. Add our Season Salt to taste. 

The sauce is best if you cover and chill it for a few hours to let the flavors meld together. This can be used as a marinade or as an accompaniment for any grilled beef.
