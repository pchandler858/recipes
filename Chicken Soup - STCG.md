### INGREDIENTS

-   1 whole raw chicken (with bones & skin for flavor) cut into it's parts
-   3 celery stalks, cut into 2 inch pieces
-   1 large onion, cut into big pieces
-   4 carrots, cut into big pieces
-   3-4 stems of thyme (or about 1 teaspoon dried)
-   3 ounces 'fine' egg noodles
-   1 Bay Leaf
-   10 Cups of chicken broth. (maybe more)
-   1 tbs soy sauce    

### DIRECTIONS

1.  Cook down onion carrots and celery
2.  Add the garlic, thyme and bay leaf
3.  Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil
4.  Once boiling, lower heat and simmer for 10 mins   
5.  Remove the bay leaf
6.  Add the chicken
7.  Add in the egg noodles then cover and cook until noodles are done -   about 15 minutes
8.  Salt and pepper to taste
9.  Add soy sauce
    
8.  And because I always seem to run out of broth before the 'stuff', I add another 2 to 4 cups chicken broth to bulk it up a bit
