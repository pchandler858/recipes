### Ingredients

-   1 lb ground beef
-   1/2 lb mild Italian sausage, ground or links with casing removed
-   1/3 cup Italian parsley, finely chopped
-   4 garlic cloves, finely chopped (1 tbsp)
-   1/2 cup Italian style bread crumbs
-   1 egg
-   3/4 cup parmesan cheese, freshly grated
-   1 tsp salt
-   1 tsp pepper, freshly ground
-   3 cups marinara sauce, store bought or homemade
-   6 hoagie rolls
-   4 tbsp olive oil
-   2 tsp garlic powder
-   8 oz mozzarella cheese, shredded

### Method

1.  Place the beef, sausage, parsley, garlic, bread crumbs, egg, parmesan cheese, salt & pepper in a large bowl. Use your hands to combine the meatball ingredients until fully combined, be careful to not overwork the mixture. Once all ingredients are combined, roll into 24 meatballs, about 2 tablespoons each.
2.  Add marinara and meatballs to a large saucepan and bring to a low simmer. Cover with a lid and cook for 10 minutes. Uncover and cook for another 10 minutes.  
    While the meatballs are cooking, brush the inside of hoagie rolls with olive oil and sprinkle with garlic powder.
3.  Preheat broiler. In a 9X13 baking dish arrange hoagie rolls and add 4 meatballs to each roll. Top each meatball sub with mozzarella. Set baking dish under the broiler and allow to cook until cheese is just melted.
4.  Top with extra parsley and enjoy!  
      
    **Meatballs can be frozen raw or frozen pre-cooked. Spread raw or cooked meatballs on a parchment lined baking sheet and place in freezer for an hour. Transfer frozen meatballs to a freezer bag. Remove air before sealing and store flat in freezer for up to 3 months.
