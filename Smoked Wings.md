### INSTRUCTIONS

#### FOR THE WINGS:

1.  Preheat oven to 250F. Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions.
2.  Dry the wings thoroughly with paper towels.
3.  Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, then place a rack on the foil. Spray the rack with nonstick cooking spray.
4.  Toss the wings with baking powder and salt.
5.  Place the wings on the baking tray in a single layer. They don’t have to be very spaced out because they will shrink while cooking.
6.  Place wings on the lower-middle oven rack and bake for 30 minutes.
7.  Move wings up to the upper-middle rack and increase the oven temperature to 425 F. Bake for 40 – 50 minutes, using [tongs](https://www.amazon.com/OXO-Grips-9-Inch-Locking-Tongs/dp/B0000CDVD8?crid=ZMCBO5I2J2JE&dchild=1&keywords=tongs+for+cooking&qid=1617799547&sprefix=tongs%2Caps%2C157&sr=8-10&linkCode=li2&tag=foodtasia08-20&linkId=1c8b5513fe474e97a236e77a46aea100&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il) to flip the wings halfway through.
8.  Remove from the oven.
9.  Toss with Buffalo Sauce or serve sauce on the side.
10.  Serve with Blue Cheese Dip and celery sticks.

#### FOR THE BUFFALO SAUCE:

1.  Heat butter and hot sauce in a small saucepan and cook over medium heat, whisking until combined.

#### FOR THE BLUE CHEESE DIP:

1.  Put the blue cheese in a bowl and mash with a fork until a paste forms. Whisk in the remaining ingredients until you have a smooth sauce. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

### NOTES

To make ahead and reheat:

If you need to make the wings ahead and reheat, do not put the sauce on them. Once the sauce is added they will start to soften. Reheat for a few minutes in a hot oven until they warmed through and they re-crisp. Toss with sauce just before serving.
