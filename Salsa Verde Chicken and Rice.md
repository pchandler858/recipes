### NOTES & TIPS

**(1) Salsa Verde.** This can be store-bought or homemade. Store-bought salsa verde is usually packaged in jar or canned form, located in the inner aisles of U.S. grocery stores. For a homemade version, check out this salsa verde recipe which uses fresh ingredients like tomatillos (small green fruits with husks).

**(2) Serving.** Serve in bowls, optionally topping with chopped fresh parsley. Serve alongside fajita-style baked vegetables or bacon-wrapped jalapeño poppers.
