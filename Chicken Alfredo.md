### Ingredients

#### For the Noodles

-   16 ounces dry fettuccine pasta

#### For the Chicken

-   1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts
-   1 teaspoon [Italian seasoning](https://bellyfull.net/homemade-italian-seasoning-recipe/)
-   3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
-   1/4 teaspoon pepper
-   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
-   1 tablespoon butter

#### For the Sauce

-   1/2 cup butter , cut into large cubes or slices (1 stick = 1/2 cup)
-   2 cups heavy whipping cream
-   1 clove garlic , minced
-   3/4 teaspoon garlic powder
-   3/4 teaspoon [Italian Seasoning](https://bellyfull.net/homemade-italian-seasoning-recipe/)
-   1/4 teaspoon salt
-   1/4 teaspoon pepper
-   2 cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese

### Instructions

-   **Make the noodles:** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fettuccine and cook until al dente according to package directions, usually 10 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water, then drain well. Set aside.
    
-   **Make the chicken:** Season chicken breasts with the Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.
    
-   Warm the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet. Once it’s shimmering, swirl the pan to evenly distribute. Add the chicken and leave it undisturbed for 5-7 minutes, until the bottom is golden-brown. Flip over and add in 1 tablespoon of butter between them, picking up the pan to give it a gentle swirl to distribute. Continue cooking for another 5-7 minutes (or an internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F.)
    
-   Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 3 minutes. Cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Tent with foil while you prepare the sauce.
    
-   **Make the Alfredo sauce:** In the same pan, over medium-low heat, add the butter and cream; whisk until butter has melted.
    
-   Add in the minced garlic, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper; whisk until combined and smooth.
    
-   Bring to a gentle simmer (do not boil) and cook for 3-4 minutes, whisking constantly, until it starts to thicken.
    
-   Stir in the parmesan cheese just until melted and the sauce is smooth. (If the sauce ends up too thick, add some of the reserved pasta cooking water, a few tablespoons at a time, to thin it out.)
    
-   **Assemble:** Take sauce off the heat and immediately toss with the cooked fettuccine noodles.
    
-   Divide the pasta among serving bowls and top with a few slices of chicken. Garnish with parsley, more Parmesan, and black pepper if desired.
