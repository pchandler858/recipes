Philly Cheesesteak Sloppy Joes are a 30 minute dinner recipe. Ground beef simmers in one pan with onion, green pepper, beef broth, A-1 sauce, and steak seasoning. Serve on toasted buns with sliced provolone cheese.

Ingredients  
1 lb lean ground beef  
1 yellow onion finely diced  
1 green pepper chopped  
½ teaspoon salt  
1 tablespoon cornstarch  
1 cup beef broth  
¼ cup A-1 Steak Sauce  
1 teaspoon steak seasoning  
sliced provolone cheese  
hamburger buns, sliders, etc.

Instructions  
In a skillet pan, over medium-high heat, cook and crumble the ground beef, onion, green pepper, and salt until beef is no longer pink. Drain.  
Stir the cornstarch into the ground beef and mix together until the meat is coated in the cornstarch. Add the beef broth, A-1 sauce, and steak seasoning. Stir together and bring to a boil.  
Once boiling, reduce heat to medium-low and let it simmer, while stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes. Mixture should thicken up and will thicken up more once it’s off the heat.  
While meat is simmering, set the oven to broil, and place the buns on a cookie sheet. Butter each bun. Broil for just a few minutes. Watch carefully as they can burn easily.  
When the meat is done use a slotted spoon to scoop it out onto each bottom bun. Place a slice of provolone cheese on the top bun. Broil for a few more minutes until cheese is melted.  
Place the top bun with the cheese on top of the bottom bun with the philly cheesesteak meat. Eat warm!

Notes  
Nutrition information is for ⅙ of the meat, one slice of provolone cheese, and one hamburger bun.If you are using slider buns or feeding lots of little kids then this recipe easily serves 8 sloppy joes. I highly recommend toasting the buns! If you don’t have the time or just don’t want to, simply serve the sloppy joe meat in a hamburger bun and eat it as is. Still yummy!I know I will get comments saying that these are not real, true, or authentic Philly Cheesesteaks. Yes, I know. They are meant to be a fast, family-friendly, budget-friendly version of the original.
